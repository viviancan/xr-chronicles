Today I learned a few basics around Unity. I spent some time reaquainting myself with a PC. It's been a few years since I have worked on a PC! I feel like I navigate much slower ðŸ˜… After that, I attmempted to stay caught up throughout the duration of the lesson. It was definitely interesting being on the other side of a classroom setting! I am very excited and looking forward to this course!

- Navigation
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- Creating objects using shapes
- Creating materials and prefabs

This is my first creation!

Today's class was centered around assets! I learned how to access Unity's asset store, download and import assets. I also spent some time practicing building terrains. One of the best parts was "painting" trees and textures on my terrain.
