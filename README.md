# XR Chronicles

This repository a place to keep track of my progress throughout a 10 week course on XR development through [Circuit Stream](https://circuitstream.com/).

I have always been interested in VR and AR develpoment, and decided to go all in with this course. By the end of the program, I will publish an XR experience.
